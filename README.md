Disney Movies and Box Office Success
Exploring Disney movie data, and building a linear regression model to predict box office success.

Project Description:
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, we are analyzing data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. We will also be performing hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contributes to its success.

Project tasks:
- Loading the file and looking at the data
- Identifying Top 10 movies at the Box office
- Movie Genre trend
- Visualizing Genre popularity trend
- Data Transformation (transforming each category value into a new column)
- Building a linear regression model
- Computing Confidence intervals for regression parameters (intercept & coefficients)

Insight:
From the results of the bootstrap analysis and the trend plot, we could say that Disney movies with plots that fit into the action and adventure genre, according to our data, tend to do better in terms of adjusted gross than other genres. 
So we could expect more Marvel, Star Wars, and live-action movies in the upcoming years!
